# Graphene-MoSâ‚‚-Gold Nanorods Hybrid Photodetector

This repository contains research on a hybrid photodetector fabricated with graphene, MoSâ‚‚, and gold nanorods (AuNRs). This combination enhances the photoresponse and sensitivity of the device across a broad wavelength range.

## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview

- **Device Structure:** Ag/Graphene/MoSâ‚‚/AuNRs/SiOâ‚‚/Si
- **Mechanism:** Photoconductor-type device with graphene, MoSâ‚‚, and gold nanorods
- **Wavelength Range:** 405â€“1064 nm
- **Key Feature:** Enhanced photodetection through the synergistic effects of graphene, MoSâ‚‚, and gold nanorods

## ðŸ§ª Fabrication Summary

- Graphene was transferred onto SiOâ‚‚/Si substrates.
- MoSâ‚‚ was synthesized and deposited onto the graphene layer.
- Gold nanorods (AuNRs) were synthesized and integrated onto the MoSâ‚‚-graphene surface.
- Silver electrodes were used for the two-terminal device configuration.
- Devices were characterized using laser illumination across multiple wavelengths.

## ðŸ“ˆ Measurements

- IV and time-dependent photoresponse (IT) under 405 nm, 532 nm, 633 nm, 808 nm, and 1064 nm lasers.
- Responsivity, photoconductive gain, and detectivity were calculated for the hybrid photodetector.
